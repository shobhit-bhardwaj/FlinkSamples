When you think of other programming languages’ names, such as BASIC, FOR- TRAN, COBOL, C, C++, and PASCAL, the name Java doesn’t really fit in. The name itself is interesting enough to garner curiosity. So just how did Java get its name? The original name for Java was intended to be “OAK”, but they could- n’t use that name because it was already taken (by Oak Technologies). Other names floating around were “Silk” and “DNA”. Apparently, the name “Java” was ultimately picked because it gave the Web a “jolt” and Sun wanted to avoid names that sounded nerdy. Java certainly does its part in making the Internet the interactive, dynamic, not to mention fun, technology that it is.
